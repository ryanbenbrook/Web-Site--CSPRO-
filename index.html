<h3>Competitive Gaming</h3>

<p>Throughout the years, gaming has been a hobby for millions of people throughout the world. The best way to describe it is as an interactive movie, where <strong><em>you</em></strong> (the player), get to make the decisions. It's only just recently that very large competitive scenes for certain games have begun to spring up. This has allowed tons of people around the world to pit their skills against the best that those scenes have to offer. Whether the games be in a 1v1 setting, or the best teams in the world going against each other, the hype following these events continues to grow. </p>
